---

## Copy Patterns

### Headlines
**Formula:** [Outcome] + [Timeframe] + [Qualifier]

Examples:
- "Generate AI Blueprints in 30 Minutes—No Tech Skills Required"
- "Launch Your First AI Pilot in 60 Days—With Our Step-by-Step Roadmap"
- "Transform Your Team's AI IQ—One Challenge at a Time"

---

### CTAs (Call-to-Actions)
**Primary CTAs:**
- "Start Your Blueprint" (not "Sign Up")
- "Get Started Free" (not "Try Now")
- "See My Results" (not "Submit")

**Secondary CTAs:**
- "Learn More" (links to docs)
- "Watch Demo" (video walkthrough)
- "Talk to Sales" (B2B only)

**Avoid:**
- Generic terms ("Click Here", "Submit", "Go")
- Passive language ("Your Blueprint Will Be Generated")
- Overpromises ("Revolutionize Your Business")

---

### Error Messages
**Formula:** [What happened] + [Why] + [What to do]

Examples:
- "We couldn't generate your blueprint. Our servers are overloaded. Please try again in 5 minutes."
- "This email is already in use. Try logging in instead, or use a different email."

**Tone:** Apologetic but not groveling. Solution-focused.

---

### Email Subject Lines
**Formula:** [Benefit] + [Social Proof or Urgency]

Examples:
- "Your AI Blueprint is Ready—Download Now"
- "500+ Executives Have Launched AI Pilots. Are You Next?"
- "You're 30 Minutes Away from an AI Strategy"

---

## Brand Don'ts

### Language to Avoid:
- **"Leverage"** → Use "use" or "apply"
- **"Synergy"** → Use "alignment" or "collaboration"
- **"Disruptive"** → Use "innovative" or "new"
- **"Best-in-class"** → Use "industry-leading" or omit
- **"Revolutionary"** → Use "proven" or "effective"

### Tone to Avoid:
- **Overpromising:** "AI will solve all your problems" → "AI can solve specific problems"
- **Jargon-heavy:** "Our NLP models leverage LLMs" → "Our AI understands natural language"
- **Passive-aggressive:** "If you had read the docs..." → "Here's how to do X"
- **Hype-driven:** "The future is NOW!" → "AI is ready when you are"

---
